In Python, the official documentation for the `requests` library is available on GitHub. You can find it here: https://docs.python-requests.org

Here's an example of a basic document:

```
# The requests module
from requests import request

url = "https://www.example.com"

response = request(url)

# The response type
print(response.status_code)
print(response.content)

# Getting the response body
body = response.json()

# Checking if the response is successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Response was successful")
else:
    print("Error occurred: {}".format(response.status_code))
```

To create a bug report, you can use the following format:

```html
<!-- Bug Report -->
<div class="alert alert-danger">
  <h4>Error</h4>
  <p>The following line of code is causing an error:</p>
  <pre><code>...(Your Code Here)</code></pre>
</div>

<!-- Title and Message -->
<h2>Title</h2>
<p>Line(s) You Are Trying To Fix.</p>

<!-- Message-->
<h3>Message</h3>
<p>(Optional: Add additional information if needed.)</p>

<!-- Solutions or Workarounds -->
<h3>Solutions or Workarounds</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Different HTTP Method</dt>
    <dd><code>{YOUR CODE HERE}</code></dd>
</dl>

<!-- Follow-up Steps and Screenshots (if applicable)-->
<h3>Follow-Up Steps</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>*{Following steps here}*</dt>
</dl>

<!-- Expected Outcome or Improvement -->
<h3>Expected Outcome</h3>
<p>(Optional: Add additional information if you're suggesting a new way to fix the issue.)</p>
```

Note that the code format above is just an example and should be adapted based on your own requirements.
