Java is a high-level, multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language created by Sun Microsystems. It was originally designed for software development tools and computing systems to be installed in computer terminals on the company's 1980s Sun system computers. Java is one of the three "essential" JVM languages which are Java, its predecessors, and the ones that follow it.

Java is a dynamic language created by Sun Microsystems as an operating system environment for development (and later deployment) of Java-based applications and software products. It supports object-oriented programming and uses concepts like polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces.

Some key differences in Java include:
- Object-oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation, which hides the implementation details behind an interface or class
- Polymorphism - allows objects of different classes to be treated differently by a runtime object.
- Inheritance - defines inheritance rules that allow multiple classes with similar behavior to be combined in one class.
- Interfaces - define methods that other classes can use as template methods or implementer methods.

The main Java language variants include:

- Java SE (Standard Edition)
- Java ME (Modified edition for Mobile Platforms)
- Java Server Pages (JSF)

As of 2018, there are several JVM versions, some being open source. The JVM version is the primary programming language used in many applications like web servers and databases.

Java is widely used in software development, but it's not only limited to software development tools but also has a wide range of applications including:

- Desktop and Server Applications
- Enterprise Software
- Games
- Web Services
- Database Management
- Mobile Apps
- Security Systems
- Wearable Devices

There are several reasons why Java is often cited as the language of choice for such applications. It's generally considered to be an enterprise-grade, high-level programming language which supports object-oriented design, has a rich set of libraries available and is supported by many popular platforms like Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, Magento, etc.

Java has also become a popular language for web development as it supports JavaFX (a JavaScript-based version of the web browser), making it easy to develop native applications on top.
